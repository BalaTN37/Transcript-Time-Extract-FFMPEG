To create a automated video creation of making someone to sing a song / to say something by having their old speaking videos
For example : Nirmala Sitharaman saying happy birthday to you
We have speech required as a text and we have many Finance minister's speech videos online.
Aim is to search for words in those speeches and at last we'll merge it (eg : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUD10vggrdo)
For now subtitles of old video will be used for decoding the audio
