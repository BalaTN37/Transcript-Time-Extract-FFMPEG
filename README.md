To create a automated video creation of making someone to sing a song / to say something by having their old speaking videos
For example : Trump singing Blinding Lights song.
We have lyrics of blinding lights and we have many trumps's speech videos online.
Aim is to search for words in the song in trump's speech and at last we'll merge it to show as Trump singing blinding lights song
For now subtitles of old video will be used for decoding the audio
